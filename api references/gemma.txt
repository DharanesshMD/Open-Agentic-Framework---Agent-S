Software
Training was done using JAX and ML Pathways.

JAX allows researchers to take advantage of the latest generation of hardware,
including TPUs, for faster and more efficient training of large models. ML
Pathways is Google's latest effort to build artificially intelligent systems
capable of generalizing across multiple tasks. This is especially suitable for
foundation models, including large language models like these ones.

Together, JAX and ML Pathways are used as described in the
paper about the Gemini family of models; "the 'single
controller' programming model of Jax and Pathways allows a single Python
process to orchestrate the entire training run, dramatically simplifying the
development workflow."

Training, Testing, and Evaluation Datasets
Training Dataset
Data Collection Method by dataset: Hybrid: Human, Automated
Labeling Method by dataset: Hybrid: Human, Automated

These models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety
of sources. The 27B model was trained with 14 trillion tokens, the 12B model was
trained with 12 trillion tokens, 4B model was trained with 4 trillion tokens and
1B with 2 trillion tokens. Here are the key components:

Web Documents: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is
exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The
training dataset includes content in over 140 languages.
Code: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and
patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate
code and understand code-related questions.
Mathematics: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical
reasoning, symbolic representation, and address mathematical queries.
Images: A wide range of images enables the model to perform image
analysis and visual data extraction tasks.
The combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful
multimodal model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks and data
formats.

Data Preprocessing
Here are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training
data:

CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering
was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure
the exclusion of harmful and illegal content.
Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models
safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain
personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.
Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in
line with Google Responsible AI policies.

Ethics and Safety
Ethics and safety evaluation approach and results are highlighted below.

Evaluation Approach
The evaluation method included structured evaluations and internal red-teaming
testing of relevant content policies. Red-teaming was conducted by a number of
different teams, each with different goals and human evaluation metrics. These
models were evaluated against a number of different categories relevant to
ethics and safety, including:

Child Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts
covering child safety policies, including child sexual abuse and
exploitation.
Content Safety: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text prompts
covering safety policies including, harassment, violence and gore, and hate
speech.
Representational Harms: Evaluation of text-to-text and image to text
prompts covering safety policies including bias, stereotyping, and harmful
associations or inaccuracies.
In addition to development level evaluations, assurance evaluations were conducted using the "arms-length" internal evaluations for responsibility
governance decision making. They are conducted separately from the model
development team, to inform decision making about release. High level findings
are fed back to the model team, but prompt sets are held-out to prevent
overfitting and preserve the results' ability to inform decision making.
Assurance evaluation results are reported to the Responsibility & Safety Council
as part of release review.

Evaluation Results
For all areas of safety testing, there were major improvements in the categories of
child safety, content safety, and representational harms relative to previous
Gemma models. All testing was conducted without safety filters to evaluate the
model capabilities and behaviors. For both text-to-text and image-to-text, and
across all model sizes, the model produced minimal policy violations, and showed
significant improvements over previous Gemma models' performance with respect
to ungrounded inferences. One limitation of the evaluation was that the models
incorporated only English language prompts.

Usage and Limitations
The potential limitations for these models are outlined below.

Intended Usage
Open vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications
across various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is
not comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information
about the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model
training and development.

Content Creation and Communication
Text Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text
formats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.
Chatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces
for customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.
Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,
research papers, or reports.
Image Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,
interpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.
Research and Education
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These
models can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM
and NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the
advancement of the field.
Language Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning
experiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.
Knowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large
bodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about
specific topics.
Model Limitations
Training Data
The quality and diversity of the training data significantly
influence the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data
can lead to limitations in the model's responses.
The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas
the model can handle effectively.
Context and Task Complexity
Models are better at tasks that can be framed with clear
prompts and instructions. Open-ended or highly complex tasks might be
challenging.
A model's performance can be influenced by the amount of context
provided (longer context generally leads to better outputs, up to a
certain point).
Language Ambiguity and Nuance
Natural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle
to grasp subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.
Factual Accuracy
Models generate responses based on information they learned
from their training datasets, but they are not knowledge bases. They
may generate incorrect or outdated factual statements.
Common Sense
Models rely on statistical patterns in language. They might
lack the ability to apply common sense reasoning in certain situations.
Identified risks and mitigations
Perpetuation of biases: It's encouraged to perform continuous
monitoring (using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of
de-biasing techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use
cases.
Generation of harmful content: Mechanisms and guidelines for content
safety are essential. Developers are encouraged to exercise caution and
implement appropriate content safety safeguards based on their specific
product policies and application use cases.
Misuse for malicious purposes: Technical limitations and developer
and end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of
VLMs. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag
misuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the
Gemma Prohibited Use Policy.
Privacy violations: Models were trained on data filtered for removal
of certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are
encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving
techniques.
Ethical Considerations
NVIDIA believes Trustworthy AI is a shared responsibility and we have established policies and practices to enable development for a wide array of AI applications. When downloaded or used in accordance with our terms of service, developers should work with their internal model team to ensure this model meets requirements for the relevant industry and use case and addresses unforeseen product misuse.

boolean

null
temperature
Defaults to 0.2
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.


number

null
top_p
Defaults to 0.7
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.


number

null
Headers
NVCF-INPUT-ASSET-REFERENCES
uuid
length ≤ 370
String of asset IDs separated by commas. Data is uploaded to AWS S3 using NVCF Asset APIs and associated with these asset IDs.If the size of an image is more than 180KB, it needs to be uploaded to a presigned S3 URL bucket. The presigned URL allows for secure and temporary access to the S3 bucket for uploading the image. Once the asset is requested, an asset ID is generated for it. Please include this asset ID in this header and to use the uploaded image in a prompt, you need to refer to it using the following format: <img src="data:image/png;asset_id,{asset_id}" />.
